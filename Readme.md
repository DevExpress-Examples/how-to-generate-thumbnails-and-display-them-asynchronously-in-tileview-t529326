# How to: Generate thumbnails and display them asynchronously in TileView


This example shows how to manually generate custom tile background images (thumbnails) in Tile View and display them asynchronously. <br><br>The TileView is bound to a list that contains texture names. We need to create custom background thumbnails for all tiles based on corresponding texture names, and display these images asynchronously.<br>Thumbnails are generated using the GetThumbnailImage event. The async image load is enabled with the AsyncLoad setting.<br><br><br>
